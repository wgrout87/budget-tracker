## Usage

Budget Tracker is a simple app allowing the user to input added funds or expenses in order to track their total financial assets. Simply add a name for the transaction, the amount of the transaction, and then click either of the buttons ("Add Funds" or "Subtract Funds") depending on the nature of the transaction. The app will then add the transaction to its database and display an updated chart showing the effects of all past transactions.
